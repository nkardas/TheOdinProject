# Cascade: CSS Methods

**Cascade: CSS Methods** is an exercise from The Odin Project's CSS Foundations course that focuses on understanding the CSS cascade, particularly specificity and rule order. This exercise provides a pre-filled HTML and CSS file, allowing you to practice editing and resolving specificity and rule order issues without adding new rules.

## Exercise Overview
